This is Project for scraping amazon and flipkart data using Selenium Library Of Python
Note that once you download this project you only have to changes path of your chromedriver according to your PC specification.
Program Works as you have give input which product you have to search it will take input and then scrape the all available data availabe on amazon and flipkart and generate csv file for that.
For pagination i have only specified for three pages so it will scrape only three pages data but if you wish to scrape all data related to that product on that website then change last_page=int(pages[-2].text)
Hope you find this project helpful.
