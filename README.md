This is a Project for scraping Amazon and Flipkart data using the Selenium Library Of Python
Note that once you download this project you only have to change the path of your Chrome driver according to your PC specification.
The program works as you have given input on which product you have to search it will take input and then scrape all the available data on Amazon and Flipkart and generate a CSV file for that.
For pagination, I have only specified three pages so it will scrape only three pages of data but if you wish to scrape all data related to that product on that website then change last_page=int(pages[-2].text)
I hope this project is helpful to you.
